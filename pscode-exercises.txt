// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
display sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
display the sum of those 2 numbers

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
check if num is even or odd
show numbers 0-100
y=odd numbers
x=even
odd numbers are not divisible by 2
check num 0-100
 list (odd numbers) 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) list numbers 0-100 
	q=10, r=20, s=30, t=40, u=50
b) sum=x
	q+r+s+t+u=sum

   divide x by u and display sum 
c)display lowest number and highest number in sequence from smallest to largest
d) I workshopped this for a couple days, I guess I need more practice with pseudocode, because I can get a few mathematical predictions to go through, but I guess I'm just struggling with the wording. I plan on workshopping this until I get it to go through.
